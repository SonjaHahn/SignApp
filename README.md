Introducing basic concepts of inferential statistics (language: German)

This shiny app is supposed to be used for teaching and learning about inferential statistics on the basis of a one-sample z-test using simulated data for several samples. It covers the topics distribution of sample means, confidence intervalls, p-values, alpha-error, beta-error and power.

The pre-set values correspond to a normal distribution resembling the outcome of a IQ-test with an expected value of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.
